 * --------------------------------
 * This file is intended for reusable helper functions that can be used across the application.
 * Examples include debouncing, throttling, or formatting functions.
 * For this initial phase, no complex utilities are required, but the file is here for modularity and future expansion.

// Example of a utility function that could be added later:
/*
export function debounce(func, delay) {
    let timeoutId;
    return function(...args) {
        clearTimeout(timeoutId);
        timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
            func.apply(this, args);
        }, delay);
    };
}
*/
