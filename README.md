# Auni - Interactive Interface (Phase 1B)

## Description

This project is an interactive, visual-only interface for Auni, a luxury-grade AI assistant. This phase implements the "Executive Flame" design, focusing on a sophisticated, professional aesthetic with responsive, mock-functional states.

The interface is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external dependencies.

## Features

-   **Sophisticated Orb Design**: A 2D, faux-3D orb with a dark, glossy finish, a subtle "heat haze" flame effect, and sonar-like ripples.
-   **Interactive States**: The orb responds to keyboard and mouse input to simulate different cognitive states.
-   **Dynamic Subtitles**: A subtitle container provides textual feedback for the current state.
-   **Fluid Animations**: All state transitions are handled smoothly via CSS.

## How to Interact

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

-   **Listen**: Hold the `Spacebar` or click on the orb.
-   **Think**: Press the `T` key.
-   **Speak**: Press the `S` key.
-   **Load**: Press the `L` key.

The orb will automatically return to its idle state after thinking, speaking, or loading. Releasing the spacebar will also return the orb to idle.
