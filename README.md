# Auni - Visual Interface

## Description

Auni is an elegant, voice-ready AI interface built from scratch. This phase delivers her glowing visual body â€” a living orb at the heart of a luxury UI.

It is a visual-only foundation for the Auni digital assistant, focusing on UI polish and animation without any interactivity or functionality yet. The visual tone is designed to be premium, futuristic, minimalist, and sophisticated.

## Features

- **Fully Responsive:** The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Multi-layered Animated Orb:** The centerpiece is a dynamic, glowing orb with several layers of CSS animations to make it feel alive.
- **No Dependencies:** This project is built with pure HTML, CSS, and an empty JavaScript file, requiring no external libraries or frameworks.
- **Pixel-perfect Modular Styling:** The CSS is organized and commented for clarity, making it easy to understand and build upon.

## How to Run

No setup is required. Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
